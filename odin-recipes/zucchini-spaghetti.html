    <h1>Zucchini Spaghetti</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>After listening to Stanley Tucci lose his mind about this pasta and calling it life-changing and one of the best things he's ever eaten, I decided I'd give it a try. 
        The results were amazing and the key to getting the toasted sweet taste of the zucchini was deep-frying it!</p>
    <p>was to fry the sliced zucchini in sunflower oil until golden brown.

        Please trust me when I tell you that the results are well worth the effort. This really was a truly amazing spaghetti, and while I've sauced pasta with zucchini before, I'd never done so by frying it first, and I was sort of shocked what a difference it makes. So, whether you need to go to the market to buy your summer squash or you're a gardener and have way more than you can ever use, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>     
    <ul>
        <li>Sunflower oil</li>
        <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
        <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Basil leaves torn into pieces</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>5 tbs grated Pecorino</li>
        <li>3 tbs grated Permigiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.</li>
        <li>Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.
        <li>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down, 3 to 5 minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts.        </li>
        <li>Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.</li>
